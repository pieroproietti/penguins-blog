## A professional and universal remastering tool for all major distributions

It took years of work to create the penguins-eggs, and I also incurred expenses for renting the site and subscribing to Google Gemini, for the artificial intelligence that is now indispensable.

### Why I'm using Google Gemini
There are many opportunities for AI, from ChatGPT, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc. 

Why did you choose [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and not [Claude](https://claude.ai)  or something else?

For a very simple reason: with a subscription of 20 euros per month, they also provide me with 2 TB of space on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) where I upload the various distributions that you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19M7fDEebPZjEY4yHD79zSMWFndCPishN?hl).
