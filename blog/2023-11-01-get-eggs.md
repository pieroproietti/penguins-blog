## How to build a reproductive, naked (CLI) system

**Note:** This article is an updated version of the previous post [addaura](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/addaura), the script now is extended to include derivatives.

We are going to describe how to go from a minimal standard installation to a complete remasterable system using [fresh-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/fresh-eggs) scripts.

This procedure work on Arch rolling, Debian (buster, bullseye, bookworm), Devuan (chimaera and daedalus) and Ubuntu (bionic, focal and jammy) and - actually - on derivatives.

### Arch
I started with latest version of archiso: `archlinux-2023.09.01-x86_64.iso`.

Then, used `archinstall` to get a minimal installation. On `Disk configuration` choose `Use a best-effort default configuration layout`, then `btrfs` or `ext4`, as you prefer.

Among the packages I added: `git`, `lsb-release`, others packages will be installed later by `fresh-eggs`.

At this point, we MUST configure network, I just choose the most basic: `Copy ISO configuration to installation`.

Finally select install and wait it finish. Archinstall will propose you to chroot to continue configuration, answer no and reboot.

### Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu
On Debian and Devuan we start with a common netinst, without install nothing except `standard system utilies`

When the installation finish, reboot the system.

After reboot, we now must install `git` and `sudo`. Log on your installed system, and:

* `su`
* `apt install git sudo`
* `/usr/sbin/adduser artisan sudo`

We can now logout, and we are ready to the next step.

The procedure its about the same on Devuan.

After reboot, we need just to install `git` to be ready: `sudo apt install git`.

On Ubuntu, we don't have net-install but we can use server edition, again without install nothing except the minimal base. Here, at the end of installation I use to remove packages `cloud-init` and `needrestart` as we are not interested on.


## Get and run fresh-eggs (all)

* `git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/fresh-eggs`
* `cd fresh-eggs`
* `sudo ./fresh-eggs.sh`

## That will happen
eggs will be installed and configured properly for the chosen distribution.

### Arch
`fresh-eggs.sh` will install few packages `bash-completion`, `dialog`, `man-db`, `nano`, `openssh` and `wget` and will add [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)  repository to pacman.conf.

Then will install penguins-eggs.

### Debian/Devuan and Ubuntu
`fresh-eggs.sh` will install new `ppa` for `penguins-eggs`, then will install eggs and its dependencies.

## Get wardrobe and wear a costume (all)
Once eggs was installed, I proceeded to load the wardrobe and "dress" the system with the colibri costume.
* `eggs wardrobe get`
* `sudo eggs wardrobe wear colibri`
At this point after rebooting, I found myself in the colibri graphical system.

## Installing calamares
We can install calamares with the command: `sudo eggs calamares --install`.

## Clean
After that, we can clean cached packages with command: `sudo eggs tools clean`.

## Remastering our custom system
Well, we are ready to remaster the system, just a little reconfiguration and cleaning before:

* `sudo eggs dad -d`
* `sudo eggs tools clean`
* `sudo eggs produce --max --addons adapt`

That's all folks!

These videos were made simply using kazam on a window, live, no audio or editing, I would need help preparing something more professional.
