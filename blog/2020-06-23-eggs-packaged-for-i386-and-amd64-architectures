Sometimes, to move forward, you need to step back first.

Well, in order to not miss the opportunity to have debian packages for both the i386 and amd64 architecture, I chose to go back to the old Node8, the latest version released by nodesource for both architectures.

The main change in this version is, of course, the presence of the i386 version, which can be a good opportunity for all people with old hardware combined with young will to experiment with them.

But not only!

Now the various READMEs, links, etc point to our new site https://penguins-eggs.net.

Come in here for more informations.
