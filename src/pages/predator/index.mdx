## Polymorphic Security Platform

It was developed in 2021 by Hossein Seilani, who is also the developer of the emperor-os, Hubuntu, and little-psycho Linux distribution. [Predator-OS](https://predator-os.ir/) is a free, open-source community project emphasizing security and academy education. The distribution is designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, privacy, hardening, and secure, anonymized Linux. Predator-OS is based on Debian 12 Stable, with kernel 6.6.15 LTS. It features a fully customized Plasma, Mate,LXQT, and LXDE desktop with a specialized menu.

[Predator-OS](https://predator-os.ir/) has approximately 1,200 pre-installed tools in 40 categories and 9 modes. These tools have been sourced from both Debian repositories and GitHub pages. Most kernel and user configurations are customized by default to prevent hacking attempts, restrict non-privileged access, and reduce the attack surface. Additionally, numerous built-in firewalls and defensive tools enable end-users to have full control over Predator-OS. Predator-OS also supports various privacy, anonymization, and security tools, and can be run as a live CD or from a USB drive, as well as in installation mode.
