# Linux Mint
![](/img/linuxmint.svg)

[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) is one of the most popular desktop Linux distributions and used by millions of people.

It is a solid and reliable distribution, for beginners and experts alike, which I greatly appreciate, both in the standard version based on Ubuntu and in the LMDE version based on Debian.

## Penguins' eggs remastered ISO's
All ISO's have their user credentials set to ```live/evolution``` and ```root/evolution```.

## Disclaim
__Please note what this project is in no way connected to the original distro in any official way, itâ€™s just my personal experiment.__
