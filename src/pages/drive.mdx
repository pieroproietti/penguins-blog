## Packages
The best way to install `penguins-eggs` on your distro is probably to use `fresh-eggs`:
* install git if not already available
* `git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/fresh-eggs`
* `cd fresh-eggs`
* `sudo ./fresh-eggs`
* and follow instructions.

fresh-eggs detects your distribution and installs the correct package, using the correct commands for your distribution.

Since you will be installing software maintained with the same package manager as your distro, removal is
easy and complete. Example: `sudo apt purge penguins-eggs` on Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu, 
`sudo pacman -R penguins-eggs` on Arch/Manjaro/Biglinux, 
`sudo dnf remove penguins-eggs` on Fedora, Almalinux, and Rocky or
`sudo zypper remove penguins-eggs` on OpenSUSE.

If you prefere, however, You can also download the package from 
[penguins-eggs.net/basket](https://penguins-eggs.net/basket/index.php/packages/?p=packages) and install it manually.
